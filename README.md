# MISO_AdaptiveSymbolDetection

This repository provides the implementation of **Neural Adaptive Symbol Detection (NASD)** for symbol detection in MISO communication systems without explicit CSI estimation.  

## ðŸš€ Overview  
NASD is a machine learning-based receiver designed for symbol detection in **MISO** systems. The model efficiently learns signal characteristics using a **tapered deep neural network (DNN)**, avoiding the need for traditional channel estimation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Adaptive symbol detection for **MISO** systems  
- **No explicit CSI estimation required**  
- **Tapered neural network** for efficient processing  
- Works under **colored noise** and **multipath fading** conditions


## ðŸ”„ Future Updates

- More detailed explanations and experiment results will be added soon.
- Additional optimizations and improvements.
